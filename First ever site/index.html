            <p>  Day 1: I created the site and messed around with html/css basic code.</p>
            <p>Day 2:Did a basic button press function but without looking anything up. I managed to think of some basic logic regarding how to go back to the first image on the same button click which made me proud as frick boyyy! Little steps...</p>
            <p>Day 3: Looked up how to implement basic layout so it stops looking like a mess here. Ended up finding out the basics of the CSS grid layout which looks like a great place to begin with how a page should look like. I also had to rearange everything because it all went bannanas.</p>
            <p>Day 4: Looked into how image resizing works within a div. Making my way towards responsive website building, but not going to do it with this one. My little button, this text and the basic grid is enough for this website. Time to move on to a new one.</p>

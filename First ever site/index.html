            <p>  Day 1: I created the site and messed around with html/css basic code.</p>
            <p>Day 2:Did a basic button press function but without looking anything up. I managed to think of some basic logic regarding how to go back to the first image on the same button click which made me proud as frick boyyy! Little steps...</p>
            <p>Day 3: Looked up how to implement basic layout so it stops looking like a mess here. Ended up finding out the basics of the CSS grid layout which looks like a great place to begin with how a page should look like. I also had to rearange everything because it all went bannanas.</p>
